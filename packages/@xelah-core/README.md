# [@xelah/core](https://xelah-core.netlify.app/)

A core library that others extend to edit their respective file formats.

This is a part of the [XELAH](https://github.com/xelahjs/xelah) collection of Libraries. 

XELAH: Simple Text Editor for React is a collection of libraries that build on top of each other. 

The primary implementation will be focused on ste-perf-html but architected to be useful for other projects needing to edit strings parsable into sections and blocks.

See the [XELAH ReadMe](https://github.com/xelahjs/xelah)

See also [@xelah/type-perf-html](https://xelah-type-perf-html.netlify.app/) - An implementation of STE for editing HtmlPerf, a block based format based on Epitelete/PERF.
